# Project 1 - Datalab Bit Puzzles

**Project Description**

This project consisted of 7 puzzles constrained to be solved using bit manipulation (shifting, masking, etc.), with some puzzles involving further restriction to allowed operations. Grading was based on correctness as well as efficiency (operation count), and the solutions here received full marks except for the last puzzle -- intLog2() -- for the efficiency portion: I was one operation short per iteration of the full-credit threshold.

**Description of Files**

bits.c

- My implementation solutions to the 7 puzzles.

bits.h

- Provided header file that allowed solutions to be tested using a grading script installed on the school servers.
